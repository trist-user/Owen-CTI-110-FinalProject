## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Repository URL: [Add repository URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- peer feedback and aid

### What I learned

trying to make a web page repsonsive to screen size with css grid is absolutely awful. I tried this way as opposed to flexboxes because I struggle a lot with flexboxes and was curious if I would find this way easier.
I was damned if i tried it and damned if i didn't.

### Continued development

For continued development, making the website look consmable on desktop would be good. Also triple checking the font, I'm pretty sure my code making it LeagueSpartan works. But my eyes are not keen enough to be able to tell 100%

### Useful resources

- [responsive grid] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_grid.asp) - helpful for finding actual code and elements to use in making the repsonsive grid (attempted responsive grid)

- [responsive grid] (https://medium.com/codetodeploy/css-grid-responsive-design-the-mobile-first-approach-that-actually-works-194bdab9bc52) - helpful for actually allowing me to understand how the code elements work individually/step by step

## Acknowledgments

Darsh, Rafal, and Alex Frieders were very helpful peers
And that website you found was also very helpful to actually explain to me what the code was doing
